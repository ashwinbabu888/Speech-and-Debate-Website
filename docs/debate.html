                    <p>Lincoln-Douglas is a prepared debate event in which you read a structured argument case and must
                        refute your opponents' arguments while defending your own. Unlike the other events, the content
                        of Lincoln-Douglas is focused on morality and philosophy as opposed to evidence-based debate.
                        Additionally, this is a single-competitor event.</p>
